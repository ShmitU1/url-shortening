# Book List Webpage

In this project I used the Reactjs library thanks to which I was able to write clean and readable code faster by also separating it into individual components. I also used SCSS preprocesor style this individual components. I used axios library to fetch the data.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- type in input some link like "google.com" and get the output with shortened version of it

### Links
- Live Site URL: https://shmitu1.github.io/url-shortening/


## My process

### Built with

- ReactJS library
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Style with SCSS preprocesor
- JavaScript ES6+
- functional components


### Useful resources

- react-icons
- react-copy-to-clipboard
- axios library
